Material Design for Angular2
---

This project is intended to be a placeholder for material design components in Angular2 until an official
implementation is provided.  

These are based very heavily on the components and styles defined in the 
[Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material) and [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular) projects.

The examples are ported pretty directly from the existing [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) docs site.
